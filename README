Sitemapper Version 1.000
========================

Description
-----------

Sitemapper is a simple perl program which generated an HTML site map from a
given URL. It does this by traversing the site, getting the home page,
extracting links from it, getting all the pages linked, and so on. The sitemap
generated is an HTML bulleted list. The first level indented list item is the
home page; the next level are all the pages linked from the home page. The next
level are all the pages linked from each of these pages, and so on. If a page
is linked from more than one page, it is show in the "highest" place in the
tree it is linked from.

Sitemapper should correctly deal with framesets, client side image maps,  and
<BASE> tags. It ignores all "off site" links - i.e. all absolute URLs that do
not start with the original "base" URL of the home page.
