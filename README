Sitemapper Version 1.003
========================

Description
-----------

Sitemapper is a simple perl program which generated an HTML site map from a
given URL. It does this by traversing the site, getting the home page,
extracting links from it, getting all the pages linked, and so on. 

The default sitemap generated is an HTML bulleted list. The first level
indented list item is the home page; the next level are all the pages linked
from the home page. The next level are all the pages linked from each of these
pages, and so on. If a page is linked from more than one page, it is show in
the "highest" place in the tree it is linked from.

An alternative sitemap format is a dynamic HTML version (see below) which
generates a collapsable folding tree.

Sitemapper should correctly deal with framesets, client side image maps,  and
<BASE> tags. It ignores all "off site" links - i.e. all absolute URLs that do
not start with the original "base" URL of the home page.

Installation
------------

Just the basic Makefile.PL stuff; i.e.:

> perl Makefile.PL
> make
> make test
> make install

Usage
-----

To use sitemapper, just type:

./sitemapper -site http://www.mysite.com/

to get output to stdout, or

./sitemapper -site http://www.mysite.com/ -output mysitemap.html

to output to a file. Type

./sitemapper -help 

to get full usage instructions, or

.sitemapper -doc

to output the pod documentation

Examples
--------

example.html contains an example of sitemapper output, for the Canon Research
Europe Ltd Perl Pages (http://www.cre.canon.co.uk/perl/); i.e. by running:

./sitemapper -o example.html -site http://www.cre.canon.co.uk/

js_example.html contains an example of a dynamic HMTL version of the site map
for the CRE site. This is generated using Jef Pearlman's (jef@mit.edu)
javascript Tree class.

Many thanks to Jef for allowing this to be distributed with sitemapper! This
is generated by running:

./sitemapper -o js_example.html -site http://www.cre.canon.co.uk/ -format js

The javascript site map requires the following gif files to be copied to the
same directory as the sitemap:

Tree_disabled.gif
Tree_minus.gif
Tree_plus.gif

Finally, a "fuller" plain old HTML version can be generated using the -format
dl option; for example:

./sitemapper -o dl_example.html -site http://www.cre.canon.co.uk/ -format dl

CPAN Modules
------------

Sitemapper uses the following CPAN modules, that need to be installed before it
will work:

Getopt::Long
IO::File
LWP::UserAgent
HTML::LinkExtor
URI::URL
Pod::Text
MD5
Date::Format

See http://www.perl.com/CPAN/ for details of how to download / install these
